# Changelog

## [1.0.2] - 2023-11-24
### Changed
- Improved error handling in console command message handler by implementing a `try/catch` block for better management of potential exceptions during process execution.

### Fixed
- Disabled the timeout for console command process to allow the process to run indefinitely without premature termination, addressing issues with long-running operations.

### Improved
- Updated the `README.md` to include instructions for manual bundle registration in `bundles.php` for users not utilizing Symfony Flex.
